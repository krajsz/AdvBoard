Validate data
	- data parser
		- min/max values
			-if invalid decide..
		- sensor types are valid
		- dashboard types are valid
Update sensors
	- use sensor ID (?) ++
	- updateSensorWithID(...) ++

Color theming

Maybe video offset
	- post processing: maybe there's an offset in our data and video start

Font sizes (QFontMetrics..) in positioning stuff

Script
	- which sensors
	- sensor order
	- stop it from Qt
Dashboard setup
	- Select dashboard type
	- Select sensors (will have some default ones for each dashboard type)
	- Layout sensors (move around, resize..)

Steps:
	1. Live or post processing
	2. a) Setup live processing
		- update interval
		- source type
			1. file: 
				- file path
			2. tcp:
				- host
				- port
		- preview? stream?
	2. b) Setup post processing
		- load sensor data file
			- validate data
		- load video data file
		- save format setup
			- video format, resize..
		- preview?
	3. a) In case of live processing:
		- Select dashboard type
			- will have some predefined sensors
			- add sensors, remove sensors, resize,etc
	3. b) In case of post processing:
		- Adding sensors is not possible, removing ok
		- Different dashboard type can be selected if no new sensors are needed (maybe inform the user that some sensors should be removed)
		- Move around, resize sensors
	4. a) Preview enabled
			- preview in full/normal screen
			- render percentage
	   b) Preview disabled 
			- render percentage
	   Cancel rendering
		- Confirmation (pause, continue)
